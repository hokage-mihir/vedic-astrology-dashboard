## Core Development Principles

### 1. Astronomical Accuracy & Calculation Quality
- Ensure precise astronomical calculations using astronomia library
- Implement proper Ayanamsa corrections for sidereal calculations
- Validate all astronomical data against known ephemeris
- Handle edge cases in lunar/solar position calculations
- Update calculations efficiently without blocking UI

### 2. Code Quality & Architecture
- Write clean, semantic React components with proper hooks usage
- Use meaningful component and function names reflecting Vedic terminology
- Implement mobile-first responsive design
- Follow React best practices (proper useEffect dependencies, memoization where needed)
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility
- Handle loading and error states gracefully

### 3. CSS & Styling Guidelines (Tailwind CSS)

#### Tailwind Configuration
- Use Tailwind's dark mode variant extensively (spiritual/meditative dark theme)
- Leverage tailwind-merge for conditional class application
- Use tailwindcss-animate for smooth transitions
- Implement responsive breakpoints: sm, md, lg, xl

#### Component Styling Patterns
- **Cards**: Clean, elevated design with subtle shadows and dark mode support
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy with proper font weights and sizes
- **Color System**:
  - Primary: Celestial blues/purples for highlights
  - Accent: Gold/amber for important information
  - Alert/Warning: Red for Rahu Kalam, Chandrashtam afflictions
  - Success/Info: Blue for positive information
  - Neutral: Gray scale for general content
- **Spacing**: Consistent spacing using Tailwind's spacing scale (space-y-4, gap-6, etc.)
- **Responsive Design**: Grid and flex layouts that adapt gracefully to all screen sizes

#### Beautification Priorities (from analysis)
1. **Gradient backgrounds**: Celestial/cosmic gradients instead of flat colors
2. **Icon integration**: Moon phases, zodiac symbols, star icons
3. **Typography enhancement**: Consider decorative fonts for headings while maintaining readability
4. **Animations**: Fade-ins, subtle pulsing for active states, smooth transitions
5. **Card effects**: Hover states with glow effects (cosmic theme)
6. **Visual separators**: Decorative dividers between sections
7. **Loading states**: Cosmic-themed loaders (rotating moon, stars, etc.)

### 4. Vedic Astrology Specific Guidelines

#### Terminology & Translation
- Use authentic Sanskrit/Vedic terms with English translations
- Maintain consistency in Rashi names: Mesh, Vrishab, Mithun, Kark, Simha, Kanya, Tula, Vrischik, Dhanu, Makar, Kumbha, Meen
- Provide clear explanations for technical terms (Chandrashtam, Nakshatra, Tithi, etc.)

#### Data Presentation
- **Current Status First**: Show what's happening now prominently
- **Time-based Information**: Always display "time left" or "changes at" for transitioning events
- **Visual Hierarchy**:
  - Critical information (Chandrashtam affliction) â†’ Red/prominent
  - Current state â†’ Primary colors
  - Future state â†’ Muted/secondary colors
- **Explanatory Context**: Brief educational content to help users understand the significance

#### Calculation Updates
- Real-time updates every 60 seconds
- Display calculation timestamps where relevant
- Handle timezone considerations (currently Mumbai-based)
- Smooth transitions when data updates (no jarring changes)

### 5. User Experience Principles

#### Mindful Design
- Create a calming, meditative interface
- Avoid overwhelming users with too much information at once
- Use progressive disclosure (tooltips, expandable sections)
- Respect the spiritual nature of the content

#### Educational Approach
- Explain "why" things matter (e.g., "Moon will induce more negative thoughts... just by being aware can save your mind")
- Provide context for astrological events
- Help users make practical use of the information

#### Accessibility
- Ensure sufficient color contrast for all text
- Provide meaningful alt text for icons/images
- Support keyboard navigation
- Screen reader friendly content structure
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion for animations

### 6. Component Architecture Patterns

#### State Management
- Use useState for local component state
- Use useEffect for calculations and intervals
- Use useCallback for memoized functions (when needed)
- Clean up intervals in useEffect return functions

#### Data Flow
```jsx
// Pattern for astronomical calculations
useEffect(() => {
  const updateData = () => {
    try {
      const calculation = performAstronomicalCalculation();
      setData(calculation);
      setError(null);
    } catch (err) {
      setError(err.message);
    }
  };

  updateData();
  const interval = setInterval(updateData, 60000); // 60-second updates
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, [dependencies]);
```

#### Loading & Error States
- Always show loading state during initial calculation
- Display friendly error messages
- Never leave users with blank/broken UI

### 7. Code Improvements & Refactoring Guidelines

#### Immediate Code Quality Issues to Address
- Replace `<br></br>` with proper Tailwind spacing utilities (space-y-2, mt-2, etc.)
- Consider extracting repeated Rashi order arrays to shared constants
- Centralize timezone handling (currently hardcoded to Mumbai)

#### Future Enhancement Priorities
1. **Visual Enhancements** (High Priority):
   - Add moon phase visual indicator
   - Implement gradient backgrounds
   - Add zodiac/astrological icons
   - Enhance animations and transitions

2. **Functional Improvements** (Medium Priority):
   - Timezone selector component
   - Tooltip system for educational content
   - Historical/future date viewing
   - Share/export functionality

3. **Performance Optimizations** (As Needed):
   - Memoize expensive calculations
   - Code splitting if bundle grows
   - Optimize re-renders

### 8. SEO Optimization Guidelines

#### Meta Tags (when deploying)
```html
<title>Moon Mood - Vedic Astrology Dashboard | Chandrashtam & Panchang Calculator</title>
<meta name="description" content="Real-time Vedic astrology insights with Chandrashtam calculator, Nakshatra details, and daily Panchang. Track lunar cycles and their spiritual effects.">
<meta name="keywords" content="chandrashtam, vedic astrology, moon position, nakshatra, panchang, tithi, rahu kalam, vedic calendar, ashtama chandra">
```

#### Structured Data (future implementation)
- WebApplication schema
- Educational content markup
- FAQ schema for common astrological questions

### 9. Development Workflow

#### Before Making Changes
1. Read the current component implementation
