## 🔧 Configuration

### Chandrashtam Data
The annual calendar uses a rolling 5-year window (current year to current year + 4),
generated automatically before every `npm run dev` and `npm run build`. Old years are
removed and the next year is added on each deploy; the files are gitignored. To
regenerate manually:

```bash
npm run data:sync
```

The calendar opens on the current year automatically.

### Customize Location
Add a city to `src/data/locations.js` (the default for new visitors is `DEFAULT_LOCATION`, Mumbai):
```javascript
{ name: 'Your City', latitude: XX.XXXX, longitude: YY.YYYY, timezone: 'Your/Timezone', country: 'Your Country' },
```

## 📚 Documentation

Detailed documentation is available in the [`docs/`](docs/) folder:

## 🎯 Core Concepts

### Chandrashtam (Chandra Ashtama)
Chandrashtam occurs when the Moon transits the 8th house from your Moon sign. This period is associated with:
- Mental and emotional challenges
- Increased negative thoughts
- Decision-making difficulties
- General stress and confusion

**The Solution:** Awareness of these periods helps mitigate their effects. Simply knowing when Chandrashtam is active can reduce its negative impact.

### Rashi Mapping

| Vrishab (Taurus) | Dhanu (Sagittarius) |
| Mithun (Gemini) | Makar (Capricorn) |
| Kark (Cancer) | Kumbha (Aquarius) |
| Simha (Leo) | Meen (Pisces) |
| Kanya (Virgo) | Mesh (Aries) |
| Tula (Libra) | Vrishab (Taurus) |
| Vrischik (Scorpio) | Mithun (Gemini) |
